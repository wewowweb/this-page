# `$this->page`
Encouraging people to publicly share the technologies used to power their websites.

Below you will - hopefully soon - find a (hopefully long) list of links to a bunch of websites' `/this-page` pages.

Add your own `$this->page` page in [README.md](https://github.com/wewowweb/this-page/blob/main/README.md).

# Contribution guide
## I want to showcase my website. How do I do that?
You can do so by creating a pull request and simply add a link, like so:

```
* [Your name](<https://yourdomain.com/uses-page-link>) - your country name (:<name of your country's flag>:) - a short description of yourself, up to 160 charachters, give or take a few. 
```
## This is my first contribution. Where can I learn to create a pull request?
**First of all, awesome! Soon you will level up and join a group of people, capable of opening pull requests! I hope this is the first step you take, among many on your open source journey.**

You can find instructions on opening pull requests by following GitHub's "Introduction to GitHub" course [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

## I'm having some issues finding the correct flag icon. Where can I find them?

GitHub has a handy cheat sheet [here](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#flags).

# FAQ
## How detailed would you like my `$this->page`?

We don't expect you to list every package or framework used by your website, but feel free to make it as detailed as you wish.

## I have some affiliate links on my `$this->page`. Is that OK?

As long as you haven't affiliated the $h!t out of your `$this->page`, it's OK. At the end of the day, we all have to earn money somehow. 

As a matter of fact, I have some affiliate links on my website as well.

## I have built a client site and would love to share a `$this->page` for it, but I can't publish it on their site due to some strict rules they have in place. Is there a workaround?

To be honest, at [We Wow Web](https://wewowweb.com) we would rather not have the content posted on our client's sites as well. 

So, if you have a freelancer/agency site, you can throw it on there and as long as it looks OK, we will accept the link.

## Do detailed "How I Built It" blog posts count as well?

This one is tricky, but no. Though, if you want to put a `$this->page` together and link additional resources on that one, that is great.
